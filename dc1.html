	<h1>Challenge:</h1>
	<p>Creating a Simple Page : Write an HTML page where there are various tags that we must consider and know about while starting to code in HTML. These tags help in organization and basic formatting of elements in your script or web pages. You have to create a web page step by step so you can get a feel for what it’s like to mark up a document with HTML tags.</p>
	<p>This is what we want you to get out of this Daily challenge:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Get a feel for how markup works, including an understanding of elements and attributes.</li>
		<li>See how browsers interpret HTML documents.</li>
		<li>Learn the basic structure of an HTML document.</li>
		<li>Pay attention to the overall structure of the document and the new terminology.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Rules:</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><b>You have until tonight at 11:59pm</b> to submit your challenge (using your Github account ).</li>
		<li>You will have to submit the link to the <b>#daily_challenge</b> Slack group with the following message: Daily_challenge - URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY” .</li>
		<li>Submissions not following the above rules will not be taken into account.</li>
		<li>Everyday, before starting the course, each one of you will present his daily challenge!</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Good to know:</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, slack, programming buddy etc…) but your instructor will not be offering any help with this daily challenge. Just like a developer you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging.</li>
		<li>Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own!</li>
	</ol>
	<h1>One Last Thing!</h1>
	<p>**Good luck!</p>
